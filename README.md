### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Harsh**](https://thisisharsh7.vercel.app), a Full-Stack Developer from Delhi, India who loves turning ideas into complete web applications.

I love building end-to-end solutions, from React frontends to Node.js backends, databases, and AI integrations.
I enjoy working in teams, solving challenging problems, and shipping products that users actually want.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:
- Listening to podcasts or music  
- Watching anime or donghua  
- Editing videos or managing social media for fun  
- Thinking about startup ideas or exploring something new

#### Fun Facts:

- I built a conversational AI platform with real-time chat and payments integration
- I draw quick sketches when I start feeling sleepy - it keeps me alert
