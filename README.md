### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>


I’m [**Harsh**](https://thisisharsh7.vercel.app), a frontend engineer based in Delhi, India.

I love crafting clean UIs, building full-stack web apps, and turning ideas into fast, responsive websites.  
I enjoy working in teams, solving challenging problems, and continuously improving how things look and work.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:
- Listening to podcasts or music  
- Watching anime or donghua  
- Editing videos or managing social media for fun  
- Thinking about startup ideas or exploring something new

#### Fun Facts:

- I once built 30+ UIs in 30 days just for fun.  
- I draw quick sketches when I start feeling sleepy - it keeps me alert.
